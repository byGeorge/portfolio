##NPC Generator

Senior Project

[Code](https://github.com/byGeorge/senorproject)

[Website](http://npc-omatic.herokuapp.com/)

The NPC Generator was written in Ruby with the Rails framework, uses Heroku as a hosting site, with a Postgres database, and the pages themselves were written in HTML with a CSS stylesheet.

I chose this project because The NPC Generator is the expression of everything I've learned so far in computer science.

##Matherator Extreme! Pretty Princess Edition

class: Software Development

[Code](https://github.com/byGeorge/portfolio/tree/master/matherator/matherator-extreme-master)

Matherator Extreme! Pretty Princess Edition was a group exercise with four members. My responsibility was the GUI. Matherator Extreme! was written in Java, uses an SQLite database, and YAML for database parsing. 

I chose this because this was the first time I had completed a large project with other people, or had created a GUI. 

##1337 Chat Server

class: Computer Networks

[Code](https://github.com/byGeorge/chatserver)

The 1337 Chat Server is a multithreaded server that allows 1337 chat clients to interact with each other. It was written in Ruby, and uses a TCP socket to service clients. 

I chose the chat server because, although it's a difficult assignment, I wrote it in four hours with Ruby. It's short (only 140 lines including white space and comments), sweet, and is a great example of the elegance of Ruby.

##Vivid Coffee

class: E-commerce

[Website](http://vivid.coffee/)

[Business Plan](https://github.com/byGeorge/portfolio/tree/master/vivid)

Vivid coffee was our group's business plan for E-commerce. We created a website for a fake business, and wrote a business plan to support it. My responsibility was to turn 5 pages of rough draft (and two pages of charts) into a finished paper that was at least 25 pages long. We got full credit on this assignment.

I chose this document because it expresses my understanding of business. 

##Super Happy Fun Quiz

class: Databases

[Code](https://github.com/byGeorge/SuperHappyFunQuiz)

The Super Happy Fun Quiz was designed as a database for the Big Shiny Geek Show Pub Quiz event held at a bar called Lucky 13. My partner provided the questions, and I wrote the database and the GUI. The GUI was written in Python and used the Django framework, using SQLite. The Super Happy Fun Quiz allowed user logins, kept high scores, and allowed the user to answer hundreds of quiz questions through the interface.

I chose this document because it was the only larger assignment I had done in the [Python](http://pythong.org/) language.

##Learning Goals

###To attain a system level understanding of the computer

Without an understanding of how an operating system interacts with software, or how data is stored, I would not have been able to complete these assignments. There isn't a specific place to apply this sort of knowledge, but the evidence lies in the way we put the pieces together. Each class offers a piece of the puzzle, and our professors are adept at explaining how each piece fits into the whole. Four of the projects that I've included demonstrate this in some way. 

The NPC Generator relied on my knowledge of networking, database integration, caching, and data storage. Matherator Extreme! Pretty Princess Edition was basically a state machine, and needed to be functional on any platform. The 1337 chat server uses persistent storage, thread management, and network knowledge. The Super Happy Fun Quiz helped my understanding of data storage, and was my first encounter with database access. 

###To understand the concepts and techniques of object-oriented software design

I demonstrate that I can design, write, and test object-oriented program in the NPC Generator. Everything is an object in Rails, and I have designed a functioning website using modern architectural patterns. Using various projects, I have demonstrated proficiency in Java, Ruby, and Python. This program has taught me that the language a programmer uses is irrelevant, except that some languages are more useful when doing certain tasks. 

###To acquire significant project experience working both individually and in a group setting

My senior project, as well as the bulk of my classwork, was written alone. However, most of the projects I've chosen here were group projects. When I came to Westminster, I hated group projects. Since then, I've learned that having another pair of eyes can save a lot of time, and that group projects almost always result in my understanding a topic better than doing solo projects. 

###To develop effective problem solving skills

Each of these assignments were given without a lot of instruction. "Learn something difficult, then do it" paraphrases the instructions my NPC Generator. For Matherator Extreme! Pretty Princess Edition, the instruction was to make a math game for kids in grades 1 to 3. Although the chat server was very specific on some things, we were allowed to write it in any language we chose. For Vivid Coffee, our class was told to pick a business idea, make a website and then make a 25-page report and presentaion. The Super Happy Fun Quiz only required a database and a GUI.

We, the students, were expected to take these minimal instructions and build great things. The professors didn't offer a lot of technical support for these classes (although they would help us figure out where to look), expecting us to deal with obstacles and setbacks as if we were in the workplace doing them professionally. 

##Conclusion

My experience at Westminster College has been an incredibly positive one, and has done a very good job preparing me for the workplace.
