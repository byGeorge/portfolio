##Matherator Extreme! Pretty Princess Edition

class: Software Development

[Code](https://github.com/byGeorge/portfolio/tree/master/matherator/matherator-extreme-master)

Matherator Extreme! Pretty Princess Edition was a group exercise with four members. My responsibility was the GUI. This demonstrated my ability to work in a team, and was the first time I had completed a significant project with other people. It also reinforced the need for testing, especially when combining code from three different people. Matherator Extreme! was written in Java, uses an sqlite database, and yaml.
