##NPC Generator

Senior Project

[Code](https://github.com/byGeorge/senorproject)

[Website](http://npc-omatic.herokuapp.com/)

The NPC Generator was written in Ruby with the Rails framework, uses Heroku as a hosting site, with a Postgres database, and the pages themselves were written in HTML with a CSS stylesheet.

I chose this project because The NPC Generator is the expression of everything I've learned so far in computer science.

##Matherator Extreme! Pretty Princess Edition

class: Software Development

[Code](https://github.com/byGeorge/portfolio/tree/master/matherator/matherator-extreme-master)

Matherator Extreme! Pretty Princess Edition was a group exercise with four members. My responsibility was the GUI. Matherator Extreme! was written in Java, uses an SQLite database, and YAML for database parsing. 

I chose this because this was the first time I had completed a large project with other people, or had created a GUI. 

##1337 Chat Server

class: Computer Networks

[Code](https://github.com/byGeorge/chatserver)

The 1337 Chat Server is a multithreaded server that allows 1337 chat clients to interact with each other. It was written in Ruby, and uses a TCP socket to service clients. 

I chose the chat server because, although it's a difficult assignment, I wrote it in four hours with Ruby. It's short (only 140 lines including white space and comments), sweet, and is a great example of the elegance of Ruby.

##Vivid Coffee

class: E-commerce

[Website](http://vivid.coffee/)

[Business Plan](https://github.com/byGeorge/portfolio/tree/master/vivid)

Vivid coffee was our group's business plan for E-commerce. We created a website for a fake business, and wrote a business plan to support it. My responsibility was to turn 5 pages of rough draft (and two pages of charts) into a finished paper that was at least 25 pages long. We got full credit on this assignment.

I chose this document because it expresses my understanding of business.
